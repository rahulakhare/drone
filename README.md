# Drone

This repository contains a variety of flight controller projects, each using different microcontrollers and development platforms. All projects are based on open-source work contributed by others in the community. I have tested these projects, and they perform better than others available.

## Included Flight Controllers

- **Arduino**: Projects that utilize Arduino boards for basic flight control tasks.
- **ESP 32 (Betaflight)**: Firmware and resources based on Betaflight, adapted for ESP32 microcontrollers.
- **STM32 (INAV)**: INAV-based firmware for STM32 series, including specific support for STM32F411CEU6.
- **General STM32**: Additional flight controller implementations using STM32 microcontrollers.
